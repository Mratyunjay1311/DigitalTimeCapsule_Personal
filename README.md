## 🗂 Project Overview

Digital Time Capsule is a web app where users can:

- Write personal thoughts and memories
- Save them as **capsules**
- Revisit them in the future
- Keep them secure via Firebase Authentication

The idea is to create a private space for you to talk to your future self.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Topic-wise)

### 1. 🔐 Authentication (`auth.js`)
- Uses **Firebase Authentication**.
- Users can **sign up, log in, and reset passwords**.
- Secures capsule data to individual accounts.

---

### 2. 🏠 Landing Page (`index.html`)
- Simple **Call to Action**: “Create Your First Capsule”
- Smooth UX encourages immediate interaction.

---

### 3. ✍️ Create Capsule (`form.html`)
- Form collects:
  - Title
  - Message
  - Optional future date
- Data saved to Firebase (can be Realtime DB or Firestore).

---

### 4. 📦 View Capsules (`capsulepage.html`)
- Displays capsules specific to the logged-in user.
- Shows **"No capsules created yet"** when empty.

---

### 5. 🔄 Reset Password (`reset.password.html`)
- Sends a reset email using Firebase.
- Quick and user-friendly.
